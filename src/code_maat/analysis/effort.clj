;;; The idea behind effort is to identify how much each author
;;; contributed to a module. The measure here is a bit more
;;; rough than the churn metrics. On the other hand, the metric
;;; is available for all supported VCS.
;;; I use the generated statistics as a guide when refactoring;
;;; by ranking the authors based on their amount of contribution
;;; I know who to ask when visiting a new module.
;;;
;;; The analysis in the module is based on research by
;;; Marco Dâ€™Ambros, Harald C. Gall, Michele Lanza, and Martin Pinzger.
